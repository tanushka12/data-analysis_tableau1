Blending feature in tableau helps us to join various different sheets in the same excel file with the same as well as different column names.

The following are included in the project:
1. Primary and Secondary Tables.
2. How to add own elements to the join (in the project - period and region).
3. Blending feature aggregates the data and then joins the data in the final result.
4. Blending is used to create a left outer join.
